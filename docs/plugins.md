# Plugins

Plugins are the core of Backstage functionality.  
They add pages, cards, or APIs to your internal portal.

## Common Plugins

- **Catalog** – view all software entities
- **Scaffolder** – create new projects
- **TechDocs** – view documentation
- **Search** – find entities across plugins
- **API Docs** – explore OpenAPI and GraphQL endpoints

You can create your own plugin:

```bash
yarn create-plugin my-plugin
```
